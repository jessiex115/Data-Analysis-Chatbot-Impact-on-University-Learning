**Analyzing Dataset of University Students’ Perceptions of AI Chatbots: Exploring Clustering and Insights into Learner Profiles**

This project analyzes the dataset "Impact of Chatbots on University Students' Learning Experiences" from Kaggle, focusing on university students' perceptions of chatbots and their impact on learning. The goal is to explore students' attitudes toward AI-driven chatbots and their educational influence.
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data to identify trends in demographics and chatbot usage.
3. **Demographic Analysis**: Examining how demographics influence chatbot perceptions and usage patterns.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing open-ended survey responses to assess student sentiment toward chatbots using NLP techniques.
5. **Clustering**: Grouping students based on usage patterns using K-Means clustering.
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Investigating correlations and testing hypotheses to uncover significant insights.
7. **Recommendations**: Providing suggestions for improving chatbot design based on the findings.

This project aims to offer insights into the role of AI in enhancing student learning and inform future chatbot development in educational contexts.

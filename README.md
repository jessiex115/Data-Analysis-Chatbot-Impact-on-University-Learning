# **Analyzing Dataset of University Students’ Perceptions of AI Chatbots: Exploring Clustering and Insights into Learner Profiles**

## **Overview**

This project analyzes the dataset "Impact of Chatbots on University Students' Learning Experiences" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/chatbots-impact-on-university-learning). The goal is to explore student perceptions of chatbots, perform sentiment analysis, cluster students based on usage patterns, and provide recommendations for chatbot improvements.

## **Steps and Methodology**

**1. Data Processing and Visualization**
**Tasks**: Preprocess and visualize demographic data, AI usage, and attitudes with pie charts, count plots, and bar charts.

**Outcome**: Cleaned and visualized dataset ready for further analysis.

**2. Sentiment Analysis**

**Tasks**: Analyze feedback sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and extract keywords.

**Outcome**: Insights into student satisfaction and areas for improvement.

**3. Frequent Users’ Perceptions**

**Tasks**: Visualize the benefits and challenges perceived by frequent AI users (Q8, Q9).

**Outcome**: Bar charts showing frequent users' attitudes toward AI’s effectiveness and limitations.

**4. Infrequent Users’ Concerns**

**Tasks**: Visualize concerns and willingness of infrequent users toward AI (Q6, Q7).

**Outcome**: Insights into barriers to AI adoption among students.

**5. Clustering Analysis**

**Tasks**: Apply K-Means and hierarchical clustering to identify patterns in student attitudes.

**Outcome**: Clusters that highlight different user profiles based on AI perceptions.

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

**Key Findings**: Mixed perceptions of AI, with benefits for frequent users but concerns over over-reliance and ethics.

**Advice**: Improve AI functionality, address ethical concerns, target training for different user groups, and use continuous feedback for improvements.
